Hi! My name is Jane. Welcome to my humble abode in the middle of the Internet.

<br/>

I have a [blog](/blog.html) where I talk about all sorts of nerdy topics, which usually consist of the latest subject to pique my
interest... whether it be video game design, computer graphics, music, storytelling, animation, books, or medicine.   

<br/>

This site is still fairly new, so please bear with me while I finish setting it up! Once it's finished, there
will also be a nicely formatted view of my resume (along with a PDF version to download) and a comprehensive list of
the personal projects I have devoted myself to over the years.
